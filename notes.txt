### OTP Password format

    - 48 bit public user id
    - 128 bit password
        - calculated based on various internal fields (???), a RNG, and a persistent counter
            - 6 byte private id field used in OTP verification.  typically set to 0 when not used.
            - 2 counter fields
                - first counter is persistent and increments once per power cycle
                - second counter is volatile and increments once per OTP generation
            - 24 bit timer field.  For 8 Hz timer for increasing entropy.  It's initialized
            with a random number at power up and increments at 8 Hz.
            - 16 bit random number
            - CRC16 of all fields
    - encoded into 4 bit encoded characters chosen by yubikey for best keyboard consistency across different locales.
